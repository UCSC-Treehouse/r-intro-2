These are course notes for the "Introduction to R" course given by Treehouse and the Vaske lab on Saturday November 16. The class will be held in 123 Sinsheimer on Saturday November 16. 

### Schedule & logistics {-}

```
10:00am   Welcome overview, Starting out in R, Data frames 
12.30pm   Lunch Break 
1.30pm    Plotting with ggplot2, Summarizing data, Thinking in R 
3.00pm    End Workshop
```

R is a programming language used by many computational biologists. The purpose of this session is to give students who are interested in the Treehouse Undergraduate Bioinformatics Immersion (https://forms.gle/UpfxJgNnB1oe69qL7) a chance to gain some experience with R in a systematic way. 

NOTE: The building will be locked, but we will let you in at the back door (via Steinhart Way). 

The training session will require that you have a laptop and a web browser. 

We will have a lunch break, but lunch is not provided.

During the workshop we will be using the RStudio Cloud to use R over the web:

* [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)

R is the language itself. RStudio provides a convenient environment in which to use R, either on your local computer or on a server.

### About this class {-}

The class was developed by the [Monash Bioinformatics Platform](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/bioinformatics) for the [Monash Data Fluency](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/) initiative. The teaching style is based on the style of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). This is a new version of the course focussing on the modern [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages. We believe this is currently the quickest route to being productive in R.

### Source code {-}

This book was created in R using the `rmarkdown` and `bookdown` packages!

### Authors and copyright {-}

This course is developed for the Monash Bioinformatics Platform by Paul Harrison.
