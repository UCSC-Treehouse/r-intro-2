["index.html", "Introduction to R, version 2 Introduction", " Introduction to R, version 2 Introduction These are course notes for the “Introduction to R” course given by Treehouse and the Vaske lab. The class was developed by the Monash Bioinformatics Platform for the Monash Data Fluency initiative. The teaching style is based on the style of The Carpentries. This is a new version of the course focussing on the modern Tidyverse set of packages. We believe this is currently the quickest route to being productive in R. PDF version for printing ZIP of data files used in this workshop During the workshop we will be using the RStudio Cloud to use R over the web: RStudio Cloud You can also install R on your own computer. There are two things to download and install: Download R Download RStudio R is the language itself. RStudio provides a convenient environment in which to use R, either on your local computer or on a server. Source code This book was created in R using the rmarkdown and bookdown packages!

["starting-out-in-r.html", "1 Starting out in R 1.1 Variables 1.2 Saving code in an R script 1.3 Vectors 1.4 Types of vector 1.5 Indexing vectors 1.6 Sequences 1.7 Functions", " 1 Starting out in R R is both a programming language and an interactive environment for data exploration and statistics. Today we will be concentrating on R as an interactive environment. Working with R is primarily text-based. The basic mode of use for R is that the user types in a command in the R language and presses enter, and then R computes and displays the result. We will be working in RStudio. The easiest way to get started is to go to RStudio Cloud and create a new project. Monash staff and students can log in using their Monash Google account. The main way of working with R is the console, where you enter commands and view results. RStudio surrounds this with various conveniences. In addition to the console panel, RStudio provides panels containing: A text editor, where R commands can be recorded for future reference. A history of commands that have been typed on the console. An “environment” pane with a list of variables, which contain values that R has been told to save from previous commands. A file manager. Help on the functions available in R. A panel to show plots. Open RStudio, click on the “Console” pane, type 1+1 and press enter. R displays the result of the calculation. In this document, we will show such an interaction with R as below. 1+1 ## [1] 2 + is called an operator. R has the operators you would expect for for basic mathematics: + - * / ^. It also has operators that do more obscure things. * has higher precedence than +. We can use brackets if necessary ( ). Try 1+2*3 and (1+2)*3. Spaces can be used to make code easier to read. We can compare with == &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=. This produces a logical value, TRUE or FALSE. Note the double equals, ==, for equality comparison. 2 * 2 == 4 ## [1] TRUE There are also character strings such as &quot;string&quot;. A character string must be surrounded by either single or double quotes. 1.1 Variables A variable is a name for a value. We can create a new variable by assigning a value to it using &lt;-. width &lt;- 5 RStudio helpfully shows us the variable in the “Environment” pane. We can also print it by typing the name of the variable and hitting enter. In general, R will print to the console any object returned by a function or operation unless we assign it to a variable. width ## [1] 5 Examples of valid variables names: hello, subject_id, subject.ID, x42. Spaces aren’t ok inside variable names. Dots (.) are ok in R, unlike in many other languages. Numbers are ok, except as the first character. Punctuation is not allowed, with two exceptions: _ and .. We can do arithmetic with the variable: # Area of a square width * width ## [1] 25 and even save the result in another variable: # Save area in &quot;area&quot; variable area &lt;- width * width We can also change a variable’s value by assigning it a new value: width &lt;- 10 width ## [1] 10 area ## [1] 25 Notice that the value of area we calculated earlier hasn’t been updated. Assigning a new value to one variable does not change the values of other variables. This is different to a spreadsheet, but usual for programming languages. 1.2 Saving code in an R script Once we’ve created a few variables, it becomes important to record how they were calculated so we can reproduce them later. The usual workflow is to save your code in an R script (“.R file”). Go to “File/New File/R Script” to create a new R script. Code in your R script can be sent to the console by selecting it or placing the cursor on the correct line, and then pressing Control-Enter (Command-Enter on a Mac). Tip Add comments to code, using lines starting with the # character. This makes it easier for others to follow what the code is doing (and also for us the next time we come back to it). Challenge: using variables Re-write this calculation so that it doesn’t use variables: a &lt;- 4*20 b &lt;- 7 a+b Re-write this calcuation over multiple lines, using a variable: 2*2+2*2+2*2 1.3 Vectors A vector of numbers is a collection of numbers. “Vector” means different things in different fields (mathematics, geometry, biology), but in R it is a fancy name for a collection of numbers. We call the individual numbers elements of the vector. We can make vectors with c( ), for example c(1,2,3). c means “combine”. R is obsesssed with vectors, in R even single numbers are vectors of length one. Many things that can be done with a single number can also be done with a vector. For example arithmetic can be done on vectors as it can be on single numbers. myvec &lt;- c(10,20,30,40,50) myvec ## [1] 10 20 30 40 50 myvec + 1 ## [1] 11 21 31 41 51 myvec + myvec ## [1] 20 40 60 80 100 length(myvec) ## [1] 5 c(60, myvec) ## [1] 60 10 20 30 40 50 c(myvec, myvec) ## [1] 10 20 30 40 50 10 20 30 40 50 When we talk about the length of a vector, we are talking about the number of numbers in the vector. 1.4 Types of vector We will also encounter vectors of character strings, for example &quot;hello&quot; or c(&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;). Also we will encounter “logical” vectors, which contain TRUE and FALSE values. R also has “factors”, which are categorical vectors, and behave much like character vectors (think the factors in an experiment). Challenge: mixing types Sometimes the best way to understand R is to try some examples and see what it does. What happens when you try to make a vector containing different types, using c( )? Make a vector with some numbers, and some words (eg. character strings like &quot;test&quot;, or &quot;hello&quot;). Why does the output show the numbers surrounded by quotes &quot; &quot; like character strings are? Because vectors can only contain one type of thing, R chooses a lowest common denominator type of vector, a type that can contain everything we are trying to put in it. A different language might stop with an error, but R tries to soldier on as best it can. A number can be represented as a character string, but a character string can not be represented as a number, so when we try to put both in the same vector R converts everything to a character string. 1.5 Indexing vectors Access elements of a vector with [ ], for example myvec[1] to get the first element. You can also assign to a specific element of a vector. myvec[1] ## [1] 10 myvec[2] ## [1] 20 myvec[2] &lt;- 5 myvec ## [1] 10 5 30 40 50 Can we use a vector to index another vector? Yes! myind &lt;- c(4,3,2) myvec[myind] ## [1] 40 30 5 We could equivalently have written: myvec[c(4,3,2)] ## [1] 40 30 5 Challenge: indexing We can create and index character vectors as well. A cafe is using R to create their menu. items &lt;- c(&quot;spam&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;beans&quot;, &quot;bacon&quot;, &quot;sausage&quot;) What does items[-3] produce? Based on what you find, use indexing to create a version of items without &quot;spam&quot;. Use indexing to create a vector containing spam, eggs, sausage, spam, and spam. Add a new item, “lobster”, to items. 1.6 Sequences Another way to create a vector is with :: 1:10 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 This can be useful when combined with indexing: items[1:4] ## [1] &quot;spam&quot; &quot;eggs&quot; &quot;beans&quot; &quot;bacon&quot; Sequences are useful for other things, such as a starting point for calculations: x &lt;- 1:10 x*x ## [1] 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 plot(x, x*x) 1.7 Functions Functions are the things that do all the work for us in R: calculate, manipulate data, read and write to files, produce plots. R has many built in functions and we will also be loading more specialized functions from “packages”. We’ve already seen several functions: c( ), length( ), and plot( ). Let’s now have a look at sum( ). sum(myvec) ## [1] 135 We called the function sum with the argument myvec, and it returned the value 135. We can get help on how to use sum with: ?sum Some functions take more than one argument. Let’s look at the function rep, which means “repeat”, and which can take a variety of different arguments. In the simplest case, it takes a value and the number of times to repeat that value. rep(42, 10) ## [1] 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 As with many functions in R—which is obsessed with vectors—the thing to be repeated can be a vector with multiple elements. rep(c(1,2,3), 10) ## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 So far we have used positional arguments, where R determines which argument is which by the order in which they are given. We can also give arguments by name. For example, the above is equivalent to rep(c(1,2,3), times=10) ## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 rep(x=c(1,2,3), 10) ## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 rep(times=10, x=c(1,2,3)) ## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 Arguments can have default values, and a function may have many different possible arguments that make it do obscure things. For example, rep can also take an argument each=. It’s typical for a function to be invoked with some number of positional arguments, which are always given, plus some less commonly used arguments, typically given by name. rep(c(1,2,3), each=3) ## [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 rep(c(1,2,3), each=3, times=5) ## [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 ## [36] 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 Challenge: using functions Use sum to sum from 1 to 10,000. Look at the documentation for the seq function. What does seq do? Give an example of using seq with either the by or length.out argument. "],
["data-frames.html", "2 Data frames 2.1 Setting up 2.2 Loading data 2.3 Exploring 2.4 Indexing data frames 2.5 Columns are vectors 2.6 Logical indexing 2.7 Factors 2.8 Sorting 2.9 Joining data frames 2.10 Further reading", " 2 Data frames Data frame is R’s name for tabular data. We generally want each row in a data frame to represent a unit of observation, and each column to contain a different type of information about the units of observation. Tabular data in this form is called “tidy data”. Today we will be using a collection of modern packages collectively known as the Tidyverse. R and its predecessor S have a history dating back to 1976. The Tidyverse fixes some dubious design decisions baked into “base R”, including having its own slightly improved form of data frame, which is called a tibble. Sticking to the Tidyverse where possible is generally safer, Tidyverse packages are more willing to generate errors rather than ignore problems. 2.1 Setting up Our first step is to download the files we need and to install the Tidyverse. This is the one step where we ask you to copy and paste some code: # Download files for this workshop download.file( &quot;https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-intro-2/r-intro-2-files.zip&quot;, destfile=&quot;r-intro-2-files.zip&quot;) unzip(&quot;r-intro-2-files.zip&quot;) # Install Tidyverse install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) If using RStudio Cloud, you might need to switch to R version 3.5.3 to successfully install Tidyverse. Use the drop-down in the top right corner of the page. People also sometimes have problems installing all the packages in Tidyverse on Windows machines. If you run into problems you may have more success installing individual packages. install.packages(c(&quot;dplyr&quot;,&quot;readr&quot;,&quot;tidyr&quot;,&quot;ggplot2&quot;)) We need to load the tidyverse package in order to use it. library(tidyverse) # OR library(dplyr) library(readr) library(tidyr) library(ggplot2) The tidyverse package loads various other packages, setting up a modern R environment. In this section we will be using functions from the dplyr, readr and tidyr packages. R is a language with mini-languages within it that solve specific problem domains. dplyr is such a mini-language, a set of “verbs” (functions) that work well together. dplyr, with the help of tidyr for some more complex operations, provides a way to perform most manipulations on a data frame that you might need. 2.2 Loading data We will use the read_csv function from readr to load a data set. (See also read.csv in base R.) CSV stands for Comma Separated Values, and is a text format used to store tabular data. The first few lines of the file we are loading are shown below. Conventionally the first line contains column headings. name,region,oecd,g77,lat,long,income2017 Afghanistan,asia,FALSE,TRUE,33,66,low Albania,europe,FALSE,FALSE,41,20,upper_mid Algeria,africa,FALSE,TRUE,28,3,upper_mid Andorra,europe,FALSE,FALSE,42.50779,1.52109,high Angola,africa,FALSE,TRUE,-12.5,18.5,lower_mid sample_metadata &lt;- read_tsv(&quot;https://xena.treehouse.gi.ucsc.edu/download/clinical_TumorCompendium_v10_PolyA_2019-07-25.tsv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## th_sampleid = col_character(), ## disease = col_character(), ## age_at_dx = col_double(), ## pedaya = col_character(), ## gender = col_character(), ## site_id = col_character(), ## site_donor_id = col_character(), ## site_sampleid = col_character() ## ) read_tsv has guessed the type of data each column holds: &lt;chr&gt; - character strings &lt;dbl&gt; - numerical values. Technically these are “doubles”, which is a way of storing numbers with 15 digits precision. We will also encounter: &lt;lgl&gt; - logical values, TRUE or FALSE. &lt;int&gt; - integers, a fancy name for whole numbers. &lt;fct&gt; - factors, categorical data. We will get to this shortly. You can also see this data frame referring to itself as “a tibble”. This is the Tidyverse’s improved form of data frame. Tibbles present themselves more conveniently than base R data frames. Base R data frames don’t show the type of each column, and output every row when you try to view them. Tip A data frame can also be created from vectors, with the tibble function. (See also data.frame in base R.) For example: tibble(foo=c(10,20,30), bar=c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## foo bar ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 10 a ## 2 20 b ## 3 30 c The argument names become column names in the data frame. Tip The path to the file on our server is &quot;download/clinical_TumorCompendium_v10_PolyA_2019-07-25.tsv&quot;. This says, starting from your working directory, look in the directory download for the file clinical_TumorCompendium_v10_PolyA_2019-07-25.tsv. The steps in the path are separated by /. Your working directory is shown at the top of the console pane. The path needed might be different on your own computer, depending where you downloaded the file. One way to work out the correct path is to find the file in the file browser pane, click on it and select “Import Dataset…”. 2.3 Exploring The View function gives us a spreadsheet-like view of the data frame. View(sample_metadata) print with the n argument can be used to show more than the first 10 rows on the console. print(sample_metadata, n=200) We can extract details of the data frame with further functions: nrow(sample_metadata) ## [1] 12236 ncol(sample_metadata) ## [1] 8 colnames(sample_metadata) ## [1] &quot;th_sampleid&quot; &quot;disease&quot; &quot;age_at_dx&quot; &quot;pedaya&quot; ## [5] &quot;gender&quot; &quot;site_id&quot; &quot;site_donor_id&quot; &quot;site_sampleid&quot; summary(sample_metadata) ## th_sampleid disease age_at_dx pedaya ## Length:12236 Length:12236 Min. : 0.0 Length:12236 ## Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.:39.0 Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Median :57.0 Mode :character ## Mean :50.7 ## 3rd Qu.:68.0 ## Max. :90.0 ## NA&#39;s :624 ## gender site_id site_donor_id ## Length:12236 Length:12236 Length:12236 ## Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## ## ## ## ## site_sampleid ## Length:12236 ## Class :character ## Mode :character ## ## ## ## 2.4 Indexing data frames Data frames can be subset using [row,column] syntax. sample_metadata[4,2] ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## disease ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 medulloblastoma Note that while this is a single value, it is still wrapped in a data frame. (This is a behaviour specific to Tidyverse data frames.) More on this in a moment. Columns can be given by name. sample_metadata[4,&quot;disease&quot;] ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## disease ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 medulloblastoma The column or row may be omitted, thereby retrieving the entire row or column. sample_metadata[4,] ## # A tibble: 1 x 8 ## th_sampleid disease age_at_dx pedaya gender site_id site_donor_id ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 THR33_1001… medull… 5 Yes, … male THR33 N/A ## # … with 1 more variable: site_sampleid &lt;chr&gt; sample_metadata[,&quot;disease&quot;] ## # A tibble: 12,236 x 1 ## disease ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage ## 2 acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage ## 3 medulloblastoma ## 4 medulloblastoma ## 5 medulloblastoma ## 6 medulloblastoma ## 7 medulloblastoma ## 8 medulloblastoma ## 9 medulloblastoma ## 10 medulloblastoma ## # … with 12,226 more rows Multiple rows or columns may be retrieved using a vector. rows_wanted &lt;- c(1,3,5) sample_metadata[rows_wanted,] ## # A tibble: 3 x 8 ## th_sampleid disease age_at_dx pedaya gender site_id site_donor_id ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 TH03_0010_… acute … 11 Yes, … female TH03 N/A ## 2 THR33_1000… medull… 7 Yes, … female THR33 N/A ## 3 THR33_1002… medull… 5 Yes, … female THR33 N/A ## # … with 1 more variable: site_sampleid &lt;chr&gt; Vector indexing can also be written on a single line. sample_metadata[c(1,3,5),] ## # A tibble: 3 x 8 ## th_sampleid disease age_at_dx pedaya gender site_id site_donor_id ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 TH03_0010_… acute … 11 Yes, … female TH03 N/A ## 2 THR33_1000… medull… 7 Yes, … female THR33 N/A ## 3 THR33_1002… medull… 5 Yes, … female THR33 N/A ## # … with 1 more variable: site_sampleid &lt;chr&gt; sample_metadata[1:7,] ## # A tibble: 7 x 8 ## th_sampleid disease age_at_dx pedaya gender site_id site_donor_id ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 TH03_0010_… acute … 11 Yes, … female TH03 N/A ## 2 TH03_0010_… acute … 11 Yes, … female TH03 N/A ## 3 THR33_1000… medull… 7 Yes, … female THR33 N/A ## 4 THR33_1001… medull… 5 Yes, … male THR33 N/A ## 5 THR33_1002… medull… 5 Yes, … female THR33 N/A ## 6 THR33_1003… medull… 3 Yes, … female THR33 N/A ## 7 THR33_1004… medull… 26 Yes, … male THR33 N/A ## # … with 1 more variable: site_sampleid &lt;chr&gt; 2.5 Columns are vectors Ok, so how do we actually get data out of a data frame? Under the hood, a data frame is a list of column vectors. We can use $ to retrieve columns. Occasionally it is also useful to use [[ ]] to retrieve columns, for example if the column name we want is stored in a variable. head( sample_metadata$disease ) ## [1] &quot;acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage&quot; ## [2] &quot;acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage&quot; ## [3] &quot;medulloblastoma&quot; ## [4] &quot;medulloblastoma&quot; ## [5] &quot;medulloblastoma&quot; ## [6] &quot;medulloblastoma&quot; head( sample_metadata[[&quot;disease&quot;]] ) ## [1] &quot;acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage&quot; ## [2] &quot;acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage&quot; ## [3] &quot;medulloblastoma&quot; ## [4] &quot;medulloblastoma&quot; ## [5] &quot;medulloblastoma&quot; ## [6] &quot;medulloblastoma&quot; To get the “disease” value of the 4th row as above, but unwrapped, we can use: sample_metadata$disease[4] ## [1] &quot;medulloblastoma&quot; 2.6 Logical indexing A method of indexing that we haven’t discussed yet is logical indexing. Instead of specifying the row number or numbers that we want, we can give a logical vector which is TRUE for the rows we want and FALSE otherwise. This can also be used with vectors. We will first do this in a slightly verbose way in order to understand it, then learn a more concise way to do this using the dplyr package. Southern countries have latitude less than zero. is_glioma &lt;- sample_metadata$disease == &quot;glioma&quot; head(is_glioma) ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE sum(is_glioma) ## [1] NA sum treats TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, so it tells us the number of TRUE elements in the vector. We can use this logical vector to get the southern countries from sample_metadata: sample_metadata[is_glioma,] ## # A tibble: 756 x 8 ## th_sampleid disease age_at_dx pedaya gender site_id site_donor_id ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 TH03_0117_… glioma 0.9 Yes, … not r… TH03 N/A ## 2 TH06_1175_… glioma 17 Yes, … female TH06 N/A ## 3 TH27_1241_… glioma NA Unkno… unkno… TH27 N/A ## 4 TH38_1311_… glioma 13 Yes, … male TH38 N/A ## 5 TH38_1346_… glioma 11 Yes, … female TH38 N/A ## 6 TH34_1445_… glioma 7 Yes, … female TH34 N/A ## 7 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 THR24_1924… glioma 5.33 Yes, … female THR24 SJHGG001 ## 9 THR24_1925… glioma 15.0 Yes, … female THR24 SJHGG002 ## 10 THR24_1925… glioma 15.0 Yes, … female THR24 SJHGG002 ## # … with 746 more rows, and 1 more variable: site_sampleid &lt;chr&gt; Comparison operators available are: x == y – “equal to” x != y – “not equal to” x &lt; y – “less than” x &gt; y – “greater than” x &lt;= y – “less than or equal to” x &gt;= y – “greater than or equal to” More complicated conditions can be constructed using logical operators: a &amp; b – “and”, TRUE only if both a and b are TRUE. a | b – “or”, TRUE if either a or b or both are TRUE. ! a – “not” , TRUE if a is FALSE, and FALSE if a is TRUE. The blash column of sample_metadata tells which countries are in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the g77 column tells which countries are in the Group of 77 (an alliance of developing nations). We could see which OECD countries are in the southern hemisphere with: senior_gliomas &lt;- is_glioma &amp; sample_metadata$age_at_dx &gt;65 sample_metadata[senior_gliomas,] ## # A tibble: 86 x 8 ## th_sampleid disease age_at_dx pedaya gender site_id site_donor_id ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 9 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 10 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 76 more rows, and 1 more variable: site_sampleid &lt;chr&gt; senior_gliomas seems like it should be kept within our sample_metadata data frame for future use.

Which countries are in neither the OECD nor the G77? Which countries are in the Americas? These have longitudes between -150 and -40. 2.6.1 A dplyr shorthand The above method is a little laborious. We have to keep mentioning the name of the data frame, and there is a lot of punctuation to keep track of. dplyr provides a slightly magical function called filter which lets us write more concisely. For example: filter(sample_metadata, sample_metadata$age_at_dx &gt;65 &amp; disease == &quot;glioma&quot;) ## # A tibble: 33 x 9 ## th_sampleid disease age_at_dx pedaya gender site_id site_donor_id ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 TCGA-CS-49… glioma 67 No male TCGA TCGA-CS-4941 ## 2 TCGA-DB-A6… glioma 67 No female TCGA TCGA-DB-A64L ## 3 TCGA-DH-A6… glioma 70 No male TCGA TCGA-DH-A669 ## 4 TCGA-DH-A6… glioma 70 No male TCGA TCGA-DH-A669 ## 5 TCGA-DU-63… glioma 66 No male TCGA TCGA-DU-6393 ## 6 TCGA-DU-64… glioma 66 No female TCGA TCGA-DU-6400 ## 7 TCGA-DU-70… glioma 74 No female TCGA TCGA-DU-7012 ## 8 TCGA-DU-72… glioma 69 No male TCGA TCGA-DU-7292 ## 9 TCGA-DU-73… glioma 67 No male TCGA TCGA-DU-7306 ## 10 TCGA-DU-81… glioma 69 No female TCGA TCGA-DU-8167 ## # … with 23 more rows, and 2 more variables: site_sampleid &lt;chr&gt;, ## # senior_glioma &lt;lgl&gt; In the second argument, we are able to refer to columns of the data frame as though they were variables. The code is beautiful, but also opaque. It’s important to understand that under the hood we are creating and combining logical vectors. 2.7 Factors The count function from dplyr can help us understand the contents of some of the columns in geo. count is also magical, we can refer to columns of the data frame directly in the arguments to count. count(sample_metadata, disease) ## # A tibble: 103 x 2 ## disease n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 acinar cell carcinoma 1 ## 2 acute leukemia 7 ## 3 acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage 2 ## 4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia 549 ## 5 acute megakaryoblastic leukemia 92 ## 6 acute myeloid leukemia 463 ## 7 acute undifferentiated leukemia 1 ## 8 adrenocortical adenoma 1 ## 9 adrenocortical cancer 78 ## 10 adrenocortical carcinoma 18 ## # … with 93 more rows count(sample_metadata, pedaya) ## # A tibble: 4 x 2 ## pedaya n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 No 9426 ## 2 Unknown 82 ## 3 Yes, age &lt; 30 years 2702 ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; 26 One annoyance here is that the different categories in pedaya aren’t in a sensible order. This comes up quite often, for example when sorting or plotting categorical data. R’s solution is a further type of vector called a factor (think a factor of an experimental design). A factor holds categorical data, and has an associated ordered set of levels. It is otherwise quite similar to a character vector. Any sort of vector can be converted to a factor using the factor function. This function defaults to placing the levels in alphabetical order, but takes a levels argument that can override this. head( factor(sample_metadata$pedaya, levels=c(&quot;Yes, age &lt; 30 years&quot;,&quot;No&quot;,&quot;Unknown&quot;)) ) ## [1] Yes, age &lt; 30 years Yes, age &lt; 30 years Yes, age &lt; 30 years ## [4] Yes, age &lt; 30 years Yes, age &lt; 30 years Yes, age &lt; 30 years ## Levels: Yes, age &lt; 30 years No Unknown We should modify the income2017 column of the geo table in order to use this: sample_metadata$pedaya &lt;- factor(sample_metadata$pedaya, c(&quot;Yes, age &lt; 30 years&quot;,&quot;No&quot;,&quot;Unknown&quot;)) count now produces the desired order of output: count(sample_metadata, pedaya) ## Warning: Factor `pedaya` contains implicit NA, consider using ## `forcats::fct_explicit_na` ## # A tibble: 4 x 2 ## pedaya n ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Yes, age &lt; 30 years 2702 ## 2 No 9426 ## 3 Unknown 82 ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; 26 We can count two categorical columns at once. count(sample_metadata, pedaya, disease) ## Warning: Factor `pedaya` contains implicit NA, consider using ## `forcats::fct_explicit_na` ## # A tibble: 163 x 3 ## pedaya disease n ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Yes, age &lt; 30 years acinar cell carcinoma 1 ## 2 Yes, age &lt; 30 years acute leukemia 1 ## 3 Yes, age &lt; 30 years acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage 2 ## 4 Yes, age &lt; 30 years acute lymphoblastic leukemia 549 ## 5 Yes, age &lt; 30 years acute megakaryoblastic leukemia 92 ## 6 Yes, age &lt; 30 years acute myeloid leukemia 303 ## 7 Yes, age &lt; 30 years acute undifferentiated leukemia 1 ## 8 Yes, age &lt; 30 years adrenocortical adenoma 1 ## 9 Yes, age &lt; 30 years adrenocortical cancer 15 ## 10 Yes, age &lt; 30 years adrenocortical carcinoma 18 ## # … with 153 more rows Challenge: counting Investigate how many OECD and non-OECD nations come from the northern and southern hemispheres using count Using count. By making a mosaic plot. Remember you may need to convert columns to factors for plot to work, and that a southern column could be added to geo with: HCB: consider adding leukemia as the example with a grep # geo$southern &lt;- geo$lat &lt; 0 2.8 Sorting Data frames can be sorted using the arrange function in dplyr. arrange(sample_metadata, age_at_dx) ## # A tibble: 12,236 x 9 ## th_sampleid disease age_at_dx pedaya gender site_id site_donor_id ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 THR08_0168… acute … 0 Yes, … unkno… THR08 SJINF009 ## 2 THR08_0169… acute … 0 Yes, … unkno… THR08 SJINF010 ## 3 TH06_0613_… atypic… 0 Yes, … male TH06 N/A ## 4 TH06_0613_… atypic… 0 Yes, … male TH06 N/A ## 5 TH06_0627_… gliobl… 0 Yes, … female TH06 N/A ## 6 THR29_0744… rhabdo… 0 Yes, … female THR29 RMS_2049 ## 7 THR29_0748… embryo… 0 Yes, … male THR29 RMS_2053 ## 8 THR29_0753… alveol… 0 Yes, … male THR29 RMS_2061 ## 9 THR29_0754… alveol… 0 Yes, … male THR29 RMS_2063 ## 10 THR29_0782… embryo… 0 Yes, … female THR29 RMS_212 ## # … with 12,226 more rows, and 2 more variables: site_sampleid &lt;chr&gt;, ## # senior_glioma &lt;lgl&gt; Numeric columns are sorted in numeric order. Character columns will be sorted in alphabetical order. Factor columns are sorted in order of their levels. The desc helper function can be used to sort in descending order. arrange(sample_metadata, desc(disease)) ## # A tibble: 12,236 x 9 ## th_sampleid disease age_at_dx pedaya gender site_id site_donor_id ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 TH03_0012_… wilms … 18 Yes, … male TH03 N/A ## 2 TH03_0012_… wilms … 18 Yes, … male TH03 N/A ## 3 TH27_1405_… wilms … NA &lt;NA&gt; male TH27 N/A ## 4 TH03_0144_… wilms … 6 Yes, … male TH03 N/A ## 5 TH27_2189_… wilms … 5 Yes, … female TH27 N/A ## 6 TH06_0632_… wilms … 4 Yes, … female TH06 N/A ## 7 THR31_0876… wilms … NA Yes, … male THR31 N/A ## 8 TARGET-50-… wilms … 6.15 Yes, … female TARGET TARGET-50-CA… ## 9 TARGET-50-… wilms … 4.68 Yes, … female TARGET TARGET-50-CA… ## 10 TARGET-50-… wilms … 1.1 Yes, … female TARGET TARGET-50-CA… ## # … with 12,226 more rows, and 2 more variables: site_sampleid &lt;chr&gt;, ## # senior_glioma &lt;lgl&gt; 2.9 Joining data frames Let’s move on to a larger data set.

It would be useful to have general information about countries from geo available as columns when we use this data frame. gap and geo share a column called name which can be used to match rows from one to the other. expression_by_disease &lt;- left_join(expression_values, sample_metadata, by=c(&quot;sample&quot;=&quot;th_sampleid&quot;)) expression_by_disease ## # A tibble: 22,908 x 11 ## Gene sample expression disease age_at_dx pedaya gender site_id ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 HRAS THR15… 5.77 osteos… NA Yes, … female THR15 ## 2 MAP2… THR15… 4.53 osteos… NA Yes, … female THR15 ## 3 HRAS THR29… 6.99 rhabdo… 20 Yes, … male THR29 ## 4 MAP2… THR29… 4.51 rhabdo… 20 Yes, … male THR29 ## 5 HRAS THR11… 6.10 glioma 13 Yes, … male THR11 ## 6 MAP2… THR11… 5.75 glioma 13 Yes, … male THR11 ## 7 HRAS THR08… 4.48 acute … 0.6 Yes, … unkno… THR08 ## 8 MAP2… THR08… 6.42 acute … 0.6 Yes, … unkno… THR08 ## 9 HRAS TH27_… 6.41 glioma NA Unkno… unkno… TH27 ## 10 MAP2… TH27_… 5.39 glioma NA Unkno… unkno… TH27 ## # … with 22,898 more rows, and 3 more variables: site_donor_id &lt;chr&gt;, ## # site_sampleid &lt;chr&gt;, senior_glioma &lt;lgl&gt; The “left” in “left join” refers to how rows that can’t be paired up are handled. left_join keeps all rows from the first data frame but not the second. This is a good default when the intent is to attaching some extra information to a data frame. inner_join discard all rows that can’t be paired up. full_join keeps all rows from both data frames. 2.10 Further reading We’ve covered the fundamentals of dplyr and data frames, but there is much more to learn. Notably, we haven’t covered the use of the pipe %&gt;% to chain dplyr verbs together. The “R for Data Science” book is an excellent source to learn more. The Monash Data Fluency “Programming and Tidy data analysis in R” course also covers this. "],

A more recent and much more powerful plotting library is ggplot2. ggplot2 is another mini-language within R, a language for creating plots. It implements ideas from a book called “The Grammar of Graphics”. The syntax can be a little strange, but there are plenty of examples in the online documentation. ggplot2 is part of the Tidyverse, so loadinging the tidyverse package will load ggplot2. library(tidyverse) We continue with the Gapminder dataset, which we loaded with: geo &lt;- read_csv(&quot;r-intro-2-files/geo.csv&quot;) gap &lt;- read_csv(&quot;r-intro-2-files/gap-minder.csv&quot;) gap_geo &lt;- left_join(gap, geo, by=&quot;name&quot;) 3.1 Elements of a ggplot Producing a plot with ggplot2, we must give three things: A data frame containing our data. How the columns of the data frame can be translated into positions, colors, sizes, and shapes of graphical elements (“aesthetics”). The actual graphical elements to display (“geometric objects”). Let’s make our first ggplot. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_point() The call to ggplot and aes sets up the basics of how we are going to represent the various columns of the data frame. aes defines the “aesthetics”, which is how columns of the data frame map to graphical attributes such as x and y position, color, size, etc. aes is another example of magic “non-standard evaluation”, arguments to aes may refer to columns of the data frame directly. We then literally add layers of graphics (“geoms”) to this. Further aesthetics can be used. Any aesthetic can be either numeric or categorical, an appropriate scale will be used. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp, color=region, size=population)) + geom_point() 3.1.1 Challenge: make a ggplot This R code will get the data from the year 2010: gap2010 &lt;- filter(gap_geo, year == 2010) Create a ggplot of this with: gdp_percap as x. life_exp as y. population as the size. region as the color. 3.2 Further geoms To draw lines, we need to use a “group” aesthetic. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp, group=name, color=region)) + geom_line() A wide variety of geoms are available. Here we show Tukey box-plots. Note again the use of the “group” aesthetic, without this ggplot will just show one big box-plot. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp, group=year)) + geom_boxplot() geom_smooth can be used to show trends. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;gam&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ s(x, bs = &quot;cs&quot;)&#39; Aesthetics can be specified globally in ggplot, or as the first argument to individual geoms. Here, the “group” is applied only to draw the lines, and “color” is used to produce multiple trend lines: ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_line(aes(group=name)) + geom_smooth(aes(color=oecd)) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;gam&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ s(x, bs = &quot;cs&quot;)&#39; 3.3 Highlighting subsets Geoms can be added that use a different data frame, using the data= argument. gap_australia &lt;- filter(gap_geo, name == &quot;Australia&quot;) ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp, group=name)) + geom_line() + geom_line(data=gap_australia, color=&quot;red&quot;, size=2) Notice also that the second geom_line has some further arguments controlling its appearance. These are not aesthetics, they are not a mapping of data to appearance, but rather a direct specification of the appearance. There isn’t an associated scale as when color was an aesthetic. 3.4 Fine-tuning a plot Adding labs to a ggplot adjusts the labels given to the axes and legends. A plot title can also be specified. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_point() + labs(x=&quot;Year&quot;, y=&quot;Life expectancy&quot;, title=&quot;Gapminder&quot;) coord_cartesian can be used to set the limits of the x and y axes. Suppose we want our y-axis to start at zero. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_point() + coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,90)) Type scale_ and press the tab key. You will see functions giving fine-grained controls over various scales (x, y, color, etc). These allow transformations (eg log10), and manually specified breaks (labelled values). Very fine grained control is possible over the appearance of ggplots, see the ggplot2 documentation for details and further examples. 3.4.1 Challenge: refine your ggplot Continuing with your scatter-plot of the 2010 data, add axis labels to your plot. Give your x axis a log scale by adding scale_x_log10(). 3.5 Faceting Faceting lets us quickly produce a collection of small plots. The plots all have the same scales and the eye can easily compare them. ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp, group=name)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ region) Note the use of ~, which we’ve not seen before. ~ syntax is used in R to specify dependence on some set of variables, for example when specifying a linear model. Here the information in each plot is dependent on the continent. 3.5.1 Challenge: facet your ggplot Let’s return again to your scatter-plot of the 2010 data. Adjust your plot to now show data from all years, with each year shown in a separate facet, using facet_wrap(~ year). Advanced: Highlight Australia in your plot. 3.6 Saving ggplots The act of plotting a ggplot is actually triggered when it is printed. In an interactive session we are automatically printing each value we calculate, but if you are using it with a programming construct such as a for loop or function you might need to explcitly print( ) the plot. Ggplots can be saved using ggsave. # Plot created but not shown. p &lt;- ggplot(gap_geo, aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) + geom_point() # Only when we try to look at the value p is it shown p # Alternatively, we can explicitly print it print(p) # To save to a file ggsave(&quot;test.png&quot;, p) # This is an alternative method that works with &quot;base R&quot; plots as well: png(&quot;test.png&quot;) print(p) dev.off() 3.6.1 Tip about sizing Figures in papers tend to be quite small. This means text must be proportionately larger than we usually show on screen. Dots should also be proportionately larger, and lines proportionately thicker. The way to achieve this using ggsave is to specify a small width and height, given in inches. To ensure the output also has good resolution, specify a high dots-per-inch, or use a vector-graphics format such as PDF or SVG. ggsave(&quot;test2.png&quot;, p, width=3, height=3, dpi=600) "],

At its simplest, this involves calculating summary statistics like counts, means, and standard deviations. Beyond this is the fitting of models, and hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculation. R has a huge number of packages devoted to these tasks and this is a large part of its appeal, but is beyond the scope of today.

If we try to calculate with NA, the result is NA NA + 1 ## [1] NA is.na can be used to detect NA values, or na.omit can be used to directly remove rows of a data frame containing them. is.na( c(1,2,NA,3) ) ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE cleaned &lt;- filter(gap2010, !is.na(life_exp)) weighted.mean(cleaned$life_exp, cleaned$population) ## [1] 70.96192 4.3 Grouped summaries The summarize function in dplyr allows summary functions to be applied to data frames. summarize(gap2010, mean_life_exp=weighted.mean(life_exp, population, na.rm=TRUE)) ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## mean_life_exp ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 71.0 So far unremarkable, but summarize comes into its own when the group_by “adjective” is used. summarize( group_by(gap_geo, year), mean_life_exp=weighted.mean(life_exp, population, na.rm=TRUE)) ## # A tibble: 22 x 2 ## year mean_life_exp ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1800 30.9 ## 2 1810 31.1 ## 3 1820 31.2 ## 4 1830 31.4 ## 5 1840 31.4 ## 6 1850 31.6 ## 7 1860 30.3 ## 8 1870 31.5 ## 9 1880 32.0 ## 10 1890 32.5 ## # … with 12 more rows Challenge: summarizing What is the total population for each year? Plot the result. Advanced: What is the total GDP for each year? For this you will first need to calculate GDP per capita times the population of each country. group_by can be used to group by multiple columns, much like count. We can use this to see how the rest of the world is catching up to OECD nations in terms of life expectancy. result &lt;- summarize( group_by(gap_geo,year,oecd), mean_life_exp=weighted.mean(life_exp, population, na.rm=TRUE)) result ## # A tibble: 44 x 3 ## # Groups: year [22] ## year oecd mean_life_exp ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1800 FALSE 29.9 ## 2 1800 TRUE 34.7 ## 3 1810 FALSE 29.9 ## 4 1810 TRUE 35.2 ## 5 1820 FALSE 30.0 ## 6 1820 TRUE 35.9 ## 7 1830 FALSE 30.0 ## 8 1830 TRUE 36.2 ## 9 1840 FALSE 30.0 ## 10 1840 TRUE 36.2 ## # … with 34 more rows ggplot(result, aes(x=year,y=mean_life_exp,color=oecd)) + geom_line() A similar plot could be produced using geom_smooth. Differences here are that we have full control over the summarization process so we were able to use the exact summarization method we want (weighted.mean for each year), and we have access to the resulting numeric data as well as the plot. We have reduced a large data set down to a smaller one that distills out one of the stories present in this data. However the earlier visualization and exploration activity using ggplot2 was essential. It gave us an idea of what sort of variability was present in the data, and any unexpected issues the data might have. 4.4 t-test We will finish this section by demonstrating a t-test. The main point of this section is to give a flavour of how statistical tests work in R, rather than the details of what a t-test does. Has life expectancy increased from 2000 to 2010? gap2000 &lt;- filter(gap_geo, year == 2000) gap2010 &lt;- filter(gap_geo, year == 2010) t.test(gap2010$life_exp, gap2000$life_exp) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: gap2010$life_exp and gap2000$life_exp ## t = 3.0341, df = 374.98, p-value = 0.002581 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 1.023455 4.792947 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 70.34005 67.43185 Statistical routines often have many ways to tweak the details of their operation. These are specified by further arguments to the function call, to override the default behaviour. By default, t.test performs an unpaired t-test, but these are repeated observations of the same countries. We can specify paired=TRUE to t.test to perform a paired sample t-test and gain some statistical power. Check this by looking at the help page with ?t.test. It’s important to first check that both data frames are in the same order. all(gap2000$name == gap2010$name) ## [1] TRUE t.test(gap2010$life_exp, gap2000$life_exp, paired=TRUE) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: gap2010$life_exp and gap2000$life_exp ## t = 13.371, df = 188, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 2.479153 3.337249 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## 2.908201 When performing a statistical test, it’s good practice to visualize the data to make sure there is nothing funny going on. plot(gap2000$life_exp, gap2010$life_exp) abline(0,1) This is a visual confirmation of the t-test result. If there were no difference between the years then points would lie approximately evenly above and below the diagonal line, which is clearly not the case. However the outlier may warrant investigation. "],
["thinking-in-r.html", "5 Thinking in R 5.1 Lists 5.2 Other types not covered here 5.3 Programming", " 5 Thinking in R The result of a t-test is actually a value we can manipulate further. Two functions help us here. class gives the “public face” of a value, and typeof gives its underlying type, the way R thinks of it internally. For example numbers are “numeric” and have some representation in computer memory, either “integer” for whole numbers only, or “double” which can hold fractional numbers (stored in memory in a base-2 version of scientific notation). class(42) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; typeof(42) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; Let’s look at the result of a t-test: result &lt;- t.test(gap2010$life_exp, gap2000$life_exp, paired=TRUE) class(result) ## [1] &quot;htest&quot; typeof(result) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; names(result) ## [1] &quot;statistic&quot; &quot;parameter&quot; &quot;p.value&quot; &quot;conf.int&quot; &quot;estimate&quot; ## [6] &quot;null.value&quot; &quot;stderr&quot; &quot;alternative&quot; &quot;method&quot; &quot;data.name&quot; result$p.value ## [1] 4.301261e-29 In R, a t-test is just another function returning just another type of data, so it can also be a building block. The value it returns is a special type of vector called a “list”, but with a public face that presents itself nicely. This is a common pattern in R. Besides printing to the console nicely, this public face may alter the behaviour of generic functions such as plot and summary. Similarly a data frame is a list of vectors that is able to present itself nicely. 5.1 Lists Lists are vectors that can hold anything as elements (even other lists!). It’s possible to create lists with the list function. This becomes especially useful once you get into the programming side of R. For example writing your own function that needs to return multiple values, it could do so in the form of a list. mylist &lt;- list(hello=c(&quot;Hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;), numbers=c(1,2,3,4)) mylist ## $hello ## [1] &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; ## ## $numbers ## [1] 1 2 3 4 class(mylist) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; typeof(mylist) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; names(mylist) ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;numbers&quot; Accessing lists can be done by name with $ or by position with [[ ]]. mylist$hello ## [1] &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; mylist[[2]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5.2 Other types not covered here Matrices are another tabular data type. These come up when doing more mathematical tasks in R. They are also commonly used in bioinformatics, for example to represent RNA-Seq count data. A matrix, as compared to a data frame: contains only one type of data, usually numeric (rather than different types in different columns). commonly has rownames as well as colnames. (Base R data frames can have rownames too, but it is easier to have any unique identifier as a normal column instead.) has individual cells as the unit of observation (rather than rows). Matrices can be created using as.matrix from a data frame, matrix from a single vector, or using rbind or cbind with several vectors. You may also encounter “S4 objects”, especially if you use Bioconductor packages. The syntax for using these is different again, and uses @ to access elements. 5.3 Programming Once you have a useful data analysis, you may want to do it again with different data. You may have some task that needs to be done many times over. This is where programming comes in: Writing your own functions. For-loops to do things multiple times. If-statements to make decisions. The “R for Data Science” book is an excellent source to learn more. Monash Data Fluency “Programming and Tidy data analysis in R” course also covers this. "],
["next-steps.html", "6 Next steps 6.1 Deepen your understanding 6.2 Expand your vocabulary 6.3 Join the community", " 6 Next steps 6.1 Deepen your understanding Our number one recommendation is to read the book “R for Data Science” by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. Also, statistical tasks such as model fitting, hypothesis testing, confidence interval calculation, and prediction are a large part of R, and one we haven’t demonstrated fully today. Linear models, and the linear model formula syntax ~, are core to much of what R has to offer statistically. Many statistical techniques take linear models as their starting point, including limma for differential gene expression, glm for logistic regression (etc), survival analysis with coxph, and mixed models to characterize variation within populations. “Statistical Models in S” by J.M. Chambers and T.J. Hastie is the primary reference for this, although there are some small differences between R and its predecessor S. “An Introduction to Statistical Learning” by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie and R. Tibshirani can be seen as further development of the ideas in “Statistical Models in S”, and is available online. It has more of a machine learning than a statistics flavour to it (the distinction is fuzzy!). “Modern Applied Statistics with S” by W.N. Venable and B.D. Ripley is a well respected reference covering R and S. “Linear Models with R” and “Extending the Linear Model with R” by J. Faraway cover linear models, with many practical examples. 6.2 Expand your vocabulary Have a look at these cheat sheets to see what is possible with R. RStudio’s collection of cheat sheets cover newer packages in R. An old-school cheat sheet for dinosaurs and people wishing to go deeper. A Bioconductor cheat sheet for biological data. The R Manuals are the place to look if you need a precise definition of how R behaves. 6.3 Join the community Join the Data Fluency community at Monash. Mailing list for workshop and event announcements. Slack for discussion. Monthly seminars on Data Science topics. Drop-in sessions on Friday afternoon. Meetups in Melbourne: MelbURN R-Ladies The Carpentries run intensive two day workshops on scientific computing and data science topics worldwide.
