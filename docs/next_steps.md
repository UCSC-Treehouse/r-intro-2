# Next steps



## How to find help

* The best source for basics is the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

* To see the documentation for a function, execute the function with a "?" in front of it like this: ?geom_boxplot

* When you don't know what command to use, or the documentation doesn't help, use Google. 

* In web searches, include the words "tidy" or "ggplot" in your search, like "ggplot boxplot". Unfortunately searching "R" isn't very specific.

* Results from stackoverflow.com are usually good discussions among users

* Web search results from tidyverse.org are good, but they're usually just the documentation

* If you find plotting results that don't use ggplot, I suggest ignoring them for now. It's hard to learn two different plotting methods. 

* Check out [RStudio's collection of cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) cover newer packages in R.


[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) run intensive two day workshops on scientific computing and data science topics worldwide. The style of this present workshop is very much based on theirs.
